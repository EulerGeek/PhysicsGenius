Project Title: QUOMA — Your Personal Physics Geek

Description:
Create QUOMA, a free, interactive physics learning website inspired by Duolingo’s approach, designed to build deep intuition through bite-sized lessons and levels. QUOMA covers three core physics areas: Classical Mechanics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics, with content based on MIT 8.01 lectures and trusted physics books.

Key Features:

Levels & Progression:
Unlock lessons progressively across topics, guiding users step-by-step from foundational classical mechanics to advanced quantum mechanics.

Intuition-Focused Learning:
Lessons emphasize conceptual clarity, visual explanations, and real-world analogies rather than heavy math.

Interactive Exercises:
Engage users with multiple-choice quizzes, drag-and-drop activities, and intuitive problem-solving prompts.

Course Structure:

Classical Mechanics (MIT 8.01 + core textbooks)

General Relativity (introductory conceptual lessons)

Quantum Mechanics (basic ideas and thought experiments)

Reference Materials:
Integrate links and excerpts from MIT OpenCourseWare 8.01, Six Easy Pieces (Feynman), Spacetime and Geometry (Carroll), and Quantum Mechanics (Griffiths).

User Interface:
Clean, friendly, and engaging UI inspired by Duolingo’s style, with progress bars, motivational messages, and clear navigation.

Accessibility:
Free access with no login required initially; room for future user accounts and saved progress.

Technical Requirements:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React preferred)

Optional backend: Node.js or Firebase for progress tracking

Responsive design for all devices

Starter Code Example (React):

jsx
Copy code
function LessonCard({ title, level, completed }) {
  return (
    <div className={`lesson-card ${completed ? 'completed' : ''}`}>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>Level {level}</p>
      <button>Start Lesson</button>
    </div>
  );
}
Additional Notes:
QUOMA’s main goal is to be your personal physics geek — making physics fun, intuitive, and accessible for learners at all levels. The platform will grow with more lessons, interactive features, and possibly community discussions.
